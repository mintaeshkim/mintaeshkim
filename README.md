## Current State
- **Ph.D. Student in Machine Learning and Control at Hybrid Robotics Lab, BAIR, UC Berkeley**
- **Working on Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Control**

## Research Interests
### High-Level
**Robust and Safe RL**, **Stochastic Control**, **Data-Efficient RL**  
*Can agent performance monotone increase using any data stream a.s.? (= Is RL scalable?)*  
*Can control create alpha in the market?*
### Low-Level
**Offline RL**, **Off2On RL**, **Off-Policy Q-Learning**, **Self/Unsupervised RL**, **Stochastic Control for Finance**
